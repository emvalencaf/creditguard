`CreditGuard` is an application for analyzing loan applications and making data-driven decisions on whether to lend to an applicant. The application uses predictive models to determine the likelihood of an applicant repaying the loan.

The chosen machine learning model is `Random Forest`, which was trained using the dataset from [laotse/credit-risk-dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/laotse/credit-risk-dataset). To learn more about the project, read [this notebook](/docs/notebook/notebook_default_loan.pt-br.ipynb).

This project was developed as part of the evaluation for the course `Smart Deployment: Systems with Predictive Models` at SENAC Pernambuco.
